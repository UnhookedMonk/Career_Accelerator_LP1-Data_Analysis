# Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis

Ideas, creativity, and execution are essential for a start-up to
flourish. But are they enough? Investors provide start-ups and other
entrepreneurial ventures with the capital---popularly known as
\"funding\"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact. In
this project, we are going to analyse funding received by start-ups in
India from 2018 to 2021. The data for each year of funding was
in a separate csv file in the dataset provided. In these files we
found the start-ups' details, the funding amounts received, and the
investors\' information.
